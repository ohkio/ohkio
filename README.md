### Quick Bio

Currently in grad school for Library Science, particularly interested in the software and technologies used to help maintain libraries and other information organizations. This is often referred to as "Systems Librarianship" or "Metadata Librarianship". Current special interests in civic tech, public transportation, and revitalizing XML tooling.

### Currently Learning

I don't have a scripting language of choice. I know how to use Python, but I don't like error messages or bug fixing in python. Looking at Lua for casual scripting.

### Programming Languages of choice

- Python - begrudgingly for data analysis
- Kotlin - for long term projects/backend
- Svelte - for UI development/frontend
- SQL - for anything database related. Not a fan of NoSQL strategies/languages
- XML - for everything metadata. Gotta get more text editor tools for librarians!!!

### Familiarity with

- Ruby
- Clojure
- Java
- JavaScript
